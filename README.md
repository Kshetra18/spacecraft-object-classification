# 🚀 Spacecraft Object Classification – Dimensat

A Python-based simulation of a spacecraft named **Dimensat** that uses various remote sensing techniques (Optical, LiDAR, Radar, Infrared, Gravitational) to detect and classify space objects.

## 🔍 Overview

This program simulates a space mission where Dimensat:
- Collects simulated data from various sensors
- Classifies objects like Satellites, Space Debris, Asteroids, and Comets
- Transmits the data back to Earth after each scan

The classification is based on simple rules derived from the sensor readings.

## ⚙️ Features

- 🛰 Simulates real-time data collection from:
  - Optical camera
  - LiDAR scanner
  - Radar sensors
  - Infrared sensors
  - Gravitational field detectors
- 🧠 Simple rule-based classification of space objects
- 📡 Simulates data transmission back to Earth
- 🧪 Runs until all known object types are detected at least once

## 🐍 Requirements

- Python 3.x

No external libraries are required. Only built-in modules (`random`, `time`) are used.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spacecraft-object-classification.git
   cd spacecraft-object-classification
